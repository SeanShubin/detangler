# Detangler

Mitigating architectural chaos as complexity increases

## Why use tooling?
- the problem is that complexity continually increases
- no amount of discipline, intelligence, or skill can scale arbitrarily if the tool you are using is the human brain
- automated feedback can narrow the relevant information to what a human brain can keep track of

## Methodology
- Quantify a problem
- Fail a build if the quantity increases
- Fix a single occurrence of the problem
- Lower the threshold

## Prerequisite Concepts
- Low Coupling
- High Cohesion
- Design By Contract
- Dependency Inversion Principle

## How to read the report
- Granularity
- Summary
- Dependency Breakdown
- Bold Circles
- Red Squares

## Find problem from graph alone

## Find problem by digging down reasons tree
